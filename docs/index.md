## Welcome to Ironclad Engine

Ironclad Engine is a passion project aimed at creating a versatile and understandable game engine for 2D and "2.5D-style" games, with a strong initial focus on supporting RPG development.

### Current State

The engine is in active Alpha development and already includes a wide range of features:

- Full scene management with stacking and overlays.
- A robust, modular input system for Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad.
- An Entity-Component-System architecture.
- Asset loading for images, JSON, and audio (via Web Audio API).
- An `AudioManager` for sound effects and music.
- A flexible UI element library.
- An initial FX system supporting screen shake, flash, and tint via offscreen rendering.
- A foundational Save/Load system with a provider pattern.

### Testbed Game: Tartu Legends

The development of Ironclad Engine is driven by the needs of **Tartu Legends**, an RPG testbed game inspired by classics like Octopath Traveler, Pok√©mon, and Monster Hunter. This ensures that engine features are practical and relevant for real-world game development.

### Dive In

- Check out the **[Getting Started Guide](./guide/getting-started.md)** to set up your first project.
- Explore the **[Conceptual Guides](./guide/introduction)** to learn about specific engine systems.
- Browse the **[Full API Reference](/api/)** for detailed information on all classes and modules.

We hope you find Ironclad Engine a useful tool for your game development journey!
